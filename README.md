# Hand Gesture Volume Control

## Description

This project demonstrates a hand gesture-based volume control system using Python. The application captures real-time video from a webcam, detects hand gestures, and adjusts the system volume accordingly. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize specific hand movements.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate hand and landmark detection.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Identifies gestures to increase, decrease, and mute the volume.
- **Volume Control**: Maps recognized gestures to system volume commands.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand tracking and landmark detection.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/paraboys/handgesturevolcontroller.git
   cd hand-gesture-volume-control
