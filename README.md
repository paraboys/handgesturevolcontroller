# HandGestureVolController

## Description

HandGestureVolController is a Python-based application that allows you to control the system volume using hand gestures. The application captures real-time video from a webcam, detects hand gestures, and adjusts the system volume accordingly. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize specific hand movements.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate hand and landmark detection.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Identifies gestures to increase, decrease, and mute the volume.
- **Volume Control**: Maps recognized gestures to system volume commands.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand tracking and landmark detection.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For controlling system volume (or any other library/tool suitable for your OS).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handgesturevolcontroller.git
   cd handgesturevolcontroller

## Install the required packages:
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt

 Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected and properly configured.
Run the application using the command above.
Use the predefined hand gestures to control the volume:
Volume Up: Raise your hand with an open palm.
Volume Down: Lower your hand with an open palm.
Mute/Unmute: Show a closed fist.
Future Enhancements
Add support for more gestures.
Improve gesture recognition accuracy.
Implement cross-platform compatibility for volume control.
